# Internet, so only the ENF network traffic itself must be routed via
# the tunnel.  It is presumed that the server admins can manage its
# security policy appropriately.

# This example configures the host to route any ENF IPv6 traffic over
# the tunnel. Routes for all other IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are
# unchanged.
