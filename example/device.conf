# Example configuration for a Xaptum ENF device client.
#
# All traffic for a device should be routed through the ENF to realize
# the full security benefits. This approach isolates the device from
# threats on the public Internet, even if it has open ports or default
# passwords.
#
# This example configures the host to route all IPv6 traffic over the
# ENF and drop all IPv4 traffic, with three execeptions.
#
# 1) DHCP(v6) and ICMP(v6) are allowed on local physical interfaces to
#    obtain last-mile IP connectivity.
#
# 2) Any interface listed in :route.trusted_interfaces: is exempt from
#    these rules.  Only interfaces attached to local, trusted (i.e.,
#    without internet access) networks should be listed here.
#
# 3) The encrypted ENF tunnel packets themselves must transit a
#    physical interface to reach the ENF. These packets are encrypted
#    and authenticated to protect from attacks on the Internet.
