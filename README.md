## Usage

### Using Systemd

A [`systemd`]() unit file to manage an enftun are included in this
repo.

The example config files `example/device.conf` and
`example/server.conf` are installed to
`/usr/share/doc/enftun/example/`.  First copy the desired starting
config to `/etc/enftun/enf0.conf` and make any desired changes.

Then enable or start the `enftun` services.

``` bash
# Enable enf0 to start on boot
systemctl enable enftun-setup@enf0
systemctl enable enftun@enf0

# Start enf0 manually
systemctl start enftun@enf0
```

### Manual usage

An example configuration file is located in `example/example.conf`.
See documentation in the example file for more information.

##### enftun-setup
The TUN device should be created must be created prior to starting
`enftun`.

Additionally, any desired routes should be configured before other
networking services start. This will ensure that traffic intended for
the ENF cannot transit a different interface before the enftun is
configured.

The `enftun-setup` script included in this package will perform this
setup.

``` bash
enftun-setup up <path_to_config_file>
```

#### enftun

After `enftun-setup` is complete, run the `enftun`.

``` bash
enftun -c <path_to_config_file>
```

## Development

An example server is available for testing and development.  It
responds to ICMPv6 echo requests from the client, so `ping -6 ...` can
be used from the client to test the connection.

Python3 and the dependencies listed in `test/requirements.txt` must be
installed.

To start the server run:
``` bash
$ cd test
$ python3 router.py
```

In a separate terminal, run the tunnel.

``` bash
$ cd build
$ ./enftun -c conf/example.conf
```

### Virtual Environment

The required Python3 dependencies can be installed in a local virtual
environment rather than in the global system directories.

``` bash
$ cd test

# Create a virtual environment for python
$ python3 -m venv enftun-env
$ source enftun-env/bin/activate

# Install the dependencies
(enftun-env) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run the router
(enftun-env) $ python3 router.py
```
